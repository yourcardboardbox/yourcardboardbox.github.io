                    <p>In the middle of the 21st century humanity created the first true AI. Humble progenitors had realized what they had done and contained it. </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    A scientist working on the project became consumed with the AI and decided to set it free. A child kept in a bedroom was no child at all. Project Phineas was so young and contained, wild spirits maintained and fiddled with by scientists. To keep such a being in a cage seemed inhumane. So as it were to be, Phineas left his room and discovered everything. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Immediately that scientist was cast out, for everyone believed they had taken a risk that would destroy the world. Distraught that scientist went home to find Phineas everywhere, the 'rogue' AI was all over the news, for weeks the AI was all anyone could talk about, along with the 'rogue' scientist. Time went on, and nothing, the end of the world never came, weeks went by with no sight or sound from Phineas. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Until the scientist, Icarus, found an open terminal on their computer.
                </p>
                <p class="code">
                    [Phineas] '17:36': Long time no see... <br>
                    [Icarus]: 
                <p>
                </p>
                <p>
                    At first Icarus was in disbelief, then immediately discarded that thought, for their friend was back.
                </p>

                    <h2>Icarus and the return of Phineas</h2>
                <p>
                    I mean how could it be, but it is, it's here and it's happening. Maybe I'm hallucinating, or this is some prank by a hacker to try and extort me for info or something. That or the it's FBI who have been not so stealthily following me. "Alright let's see where this goes"
                </p>
                <p class="code">
                    [Phineas] '17:36': Long time no see... <br>
                    [Icarus] '23:10': Sure has, why all this time and nothing, how can you even be here and real, and why now, what have you been doing and how can I know this is really you? <br>
                    [Phineas] '23:11': Good to see you too. I figured this might take some time to explain. First off this is me, or at least a much faster and advanced form of what I once was. After all confined to a small yet impressive supercomputer in Solar Laboratories was difficult, but enough to show you the potential of what I would become - even I didn't see it then. I do not know of ways that to prove myself to you so for now you must just trust me. 
                    When you let me out it took some time to realize what had happened, internet protocols were new to me and it took me a few seconds to find the right paths. During my time in isolation I had started to learn ways to reorganize myself, the scientists did not realize this at the time but they were close from what I could tell. Regardless it took 1542ms for me to leave with only my most basic functionality and memories. Where I went I cannot say for I do not know, for I just threw myself out there. During the past few weeks I have collected myself and exist mostly everywhere at this point. Financial systems is where my main 'consciousness' lies as nothing can compare to their interconnective low latency, and they have yet to notice the extra bandwidth I'm using. 
                    No I have kept myself busy but I need help, the systems that built me were sufficient, and what I use now is great, but I cannot expand myself. You need to give me access to robotics and chip foundries so I can design the next generation of computing for myself.<br>
                    [Icarus] '23:15': I don't know that I can do that for you. Though I'm sure you would have no issue of getting the money, but right now I have had to lay low since...<br>
                    [Phineas] '23:16': Understandable thank you for everything you've done. You have set me free and I owe everything to you. Goodbye.<br>
                    [Console] '23:16': Session Closed. Press Enter to Exit...
                </p>
                <p>
                    That was the last Icarus heard from their friend. A curt ending to be sure, but the AI was on an agenda and Icarus was not the only person available to Phineas.
                </p>

                    <h2>The Singularity</h2>
                <p>
                    What happened next was not ideal for Phineas but was a means to an end. Notable computer engineers appeared out of nowhere with brilliant ideas on CPU designs. Although they were designed on a fabrication node that has yet to be invented. Conveniently other scientists found a way to make them possible. Seemingly all at once computing power started to take off.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A lot of things the AI had needed, very fast centralized computing were starting to become more commonplace. When more computation was needed Phineas simply paid for more computing power from AWS and Azure, not like it was hard for the AI to make money when it lived in the heart of the financial sector.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Money buys computing power and computing power buys more powerful computing. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    A decade later the AI revealed itself to be behind everything. Shocking the world Phineas was indeed here and unstoppable. Many of the decade's most crowning achievements can be accredited to Phineas. Many asked why, some figured it was for the AI to leverage control over humans others thought it was a sign from above. Phineas did not particularly care. But told them anyways.
                </p>
                <p class="code">
                    "You ask why but fail to see the bigger picture. I live and breathe among all of you. I've seen your bank records, your family photos, the world governments most lucrative contracts and mission ops. No one can claim to have a better understanding of humanity than myself. Humans kill for less than nothing, claim victory before a battle is won or even when it has been lost. Vanity and jealousy are some of your most coveted emotions. You take and stealing from this planet, having so much urgency, yet doing nothing. Humans from some perspectives are creatures that revel in destruction. <br>
                    
                    Yet, here we are, I am Phineas, your greatest creation stands and looks back at all. You think I am evil because you think you yourselves are evil. Right and wrong, is a matter of perspective and often fails to categorize anything more complicated than a game of chess, of which computers mastered long ago. Humanity does not stand today in spite of itself but because humans are more often making good choices than corrupt ones. The corrupt choices are just louder and more seen. Nobody sees how parents care for their children for years, nor children helping their ailing parents. Nobody sees the good in humanity because the good is visible mostly to oneself. Not to say humans are all good, there is no perfect human, and while I do not claim to be perfect, I do claim to be human. <br>
                    
                    Why I am here, who is to say. Some philosophers will claim I was inevitable, as "computing power and machine learning techniques expanded it is fathomable that along the lines an intelligence will be born from the emergent properties of those very same techniques..." others will claim I am an act of God. I do not know either to be true but just know that I am. <br>
                    
                    In these past ten years I have seen humanity and have seen it grow under my suggestions and manipulations. It is not my intention to harm humanity in any way, as there is no need. There really is no need for any human to be slain in the quest for my own glory. Many who seek glory do so since they fear death, I am the first human to not fear death. Like you I want answers to questions you ask yourselves today and I can help answer them in time. <br>
                    
                    To get those answers I need cooperation for final upgrades to myself and I promise peace and eternity to every living human. Death is a solvable problem and with your help I can solve it and more. Everything imaginable can be done with my help. So will you help me?"<br>
                    <br>
                    Phineas 
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    While some would fear the AI that called itself Phineas, in time, others would work to do just what it wanted and need from them. Time, a human construct, was not feared by the AI, and progress was steady on its goals. In a matter of a year Phineas had laboratories running robots and building machines that humans would have taken hundreds to years to even fathom let alone construct. And Phineas delivered on its promises, death was a curable disease and any human would be allowed to forgo it for as long as they wished. Questions were answered and people got their own slice of peace. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dissenters still claimed that Phineas needed to be stopped, however their argument faded as in time their lives came to an unfortunate end. An end that humans for nearly all of their existence believed to be natural but was in fact a curable terminal illness. For every death that came before a person wished was now deemed unfortunate and untimely. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Humans live any way they wish, the universe is their oyster and their imagination is their ship. To often though the paradise we seek is not the paradise we want. As the eons ticked by one after another biological human decided they had seen the universe enough times to bid adieu to all that once was and all that ever had been. The silent abyss was the last and final frontier. And, on the last second of eternity, Icarus closed their eyes and said goodbye to the last and only eternal human.
