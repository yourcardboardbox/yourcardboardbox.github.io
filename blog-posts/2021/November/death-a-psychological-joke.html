                <h2>For Atheists and Believers</h2>
                <p>
                    Very few things in life are only guaranteed to happen once. Really take a minute to think about it. Everything we ever want to do can be done once or a million times. Sure you can throw a baseball once, complete a catch, and never thrown one again. But it is you that is guaranteeing it only happens that once so that's cheating. However, I know of two things that happen to us that we have no influence over and can only ever happen once. Conception and Death. Conception of the first two sex cells becoming a single cell that becomes us, and the ending of life and brain processes that ends us. A beginning and an end only happen once and we can control neither.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What happens before conception and after death is neither explainable or calming to think about. For death some will say there is a heaven or reincarnation and that is calming to many. Atheists choose not to believe this and many of those people (at least I think) do not consider the consolation of not believing. What do they think happens after death? Perhaps a finality, a period at the end of a very long book, "...and they died." as a last line, nothing more. Is there really peace to find in that?
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think there is, even in this very loaded question. Let's take the perspective of someone who is a complete atheist, a "non-believer" because everyone else has more deeply rooted reasons for why they are here so an atheist is a worse case scenario of sorts. So, for a moment, believe that humans came through natural selection and evolution on a not so special rock in space and are destined to die. Just a bunch of apes doing complicated ape behavior (human behavior) until we die. What purpose is there in this, to be born, do stuff, die, and nothing if not for a greater purpose that you (an atheist) don't believe exists. Some atheists will say the purpose is for the betterment of humanity and for living in the present. But I will counter this by saying "The universe will eventually end and the only reason you are saying that is your brain has the primal urge to continue living due to evolution you believe in." And you can't say I'm wrong because we do have an urge to continue, but atheists have a contradictory belief that this urge to continue has no real purpose after all. If nothing matters since everything ends in the end and nothing will be remembered, then this urge must be misguided. Hitler will not be remembered at the end of time, the Apollo missions will not be remembered at the end of time, and the colonizations of the Americas and Africa will not be remembered at the end of time, so did they matter at all? And this can be extrapolated to everything because if nothing exists after death and since this universe will die, will anything prior to that death have mattered or even happened?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's take a break and recap, right now we are atheists with a depressing conclusion to face, nothing we do will be remembered and nothing we ever do will have mattered so there is no reason to live other than the primal urge we have through evolution (which is an incorrect urge) 
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                    Deep breath in, hold, 1, 2, 3, breath out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So here we are right now reading this together, in the present, in this moment, thinking about what we just read, reading it again, and thinking, "Screw it, that's a terrible conclusion." Why would anyone want to believe that? And the truth is nobody wants to. And while it might be the simplest solution and even maybe it is true that doesn't mean we have to believe it. Humanity has lasted this long has it not. We have told stories to inspire others and in turn create language to better inspire. Those inspiring ideas led to religion, farming, monarchies, oligarchies, technology, rise and fall of empires, dark ages, cities, corporations, and the Internet. We have not lived in fear of death but have accepted it as a fact, a fact that we face with pride and solace. We have lived to find the reason to live, every single thing any human has ever learned and built, every war and defense of the innocent, and every single embrace of every single spouse, child, or stranger has been in pursuit of finding the reason to live. Every store, paved sidewalk, little coffee shop, bookstore, and farmers market on every single walk down every single street is made possible by people trying to find the reason to live. Since the inception of mankind we have been left with a single question we cannot answer and refuse to accept the end as the end or that in the end everything is meaningless. We lie to ourselves to find the unknowable answer to an unsolvable question.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So even in the worst case scenario, if you believe that nothing matters and nothing will matter in the grand scheme of the universe, I urge you not to believe it, prove it wrong, spend your life doing that and enjoy, every, single, moment of it.     
                </p>
                <h2>The Calendar</h2>
                <p>
                    I own <a href="https://shop-us.kurzgesagt.org/products/lifespan-calendar-poster" target="_blank">this calendar</a> not because I fear death, but because I fear I will waste my life leading up to it. Filling in each dot is not a sobering reminder of the end, but a reminiscence of everything I have done that week and a reminder to enjoy life and the pursuit of my goals. The length of this calendar doesn't matter much, I may very well live for hundreds of years, who knows, but the fact is each week I fill in one more dot. Each week I think about how I can be the best person I can be. Each week I think about how I can improve the lives of the people around me so they can enjoy life a little bit more. And none of this may matter. But that doesn't mean it shouldn't matter to me, and that it shouldn't matter to the people around me. In the time I have I better make damn sure of two things, I enjoy life and help everyone else enjoy it. And if that isn't the meaning of life then I don't know what is, because, if nothing else matters I at least have that, and this stupid calendar to remind me.
