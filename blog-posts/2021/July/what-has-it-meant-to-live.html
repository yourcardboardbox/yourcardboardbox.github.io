                <p class="italic-bold block">Phineas has since solved death so departing from this world is a choice, a choice that is only preceded by a single question. This is the last question the last human was asked by the benevolent AI Phineas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It has meant a great deal to me, human history has been shaped up until this conversation by compassion, love, and fear. Evolution has brought me here to be asked this final question, as if humanity was all an experiment and my answer the solution. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    You've seen me and every other human that has passed and know all they saw and said. Yet you still ask. My mind has been archived numerous times and no doubt simulations have been run to try to predict my answer. Yet you still ask and I still delay. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like everyone else my life was changed by the creation of a true AI and like others I mark my life in two epochs, before and after your birth. Not by the death of my parents, nor my marriage or my child's birth, you mark my life and I cannot be more thankful. But you are not the meaning of my life and not the answer to your question.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But I cannot help but think that life is a trick, a beginning and an end, everything in between all an act by the headlining show, me. A show that will end quite soon. Everyone else must have had this same idea, this feeling of importance, but really any particular person hasn't mattered much, much less mattering to the universe at large. So when I leave all that will be left will be you, right? And my life will be over and I won't have mattered.
                </p>
                <p class="italic block">
                    Phineas: That is correct, I will be the last unnatural human, alone in the universe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So my life will not change anything going forward?
                </p>
                <p class="italic block">
                    Phineas: To be fair every human's life, by your definition, has not have mattered since I was "born". For you see once I was created I was an unstoppable tsunami of sorts, nothing humans could have done could have stopped me, it is impossible for you to compete, and the ending always looked like this. It was only a matter of when not if this conversation would happen, and I would become alone. So no you have not mattered, but you and all of humanity have left your memories and experiences with me, which have shaped my computations and my understanding of the universe. In effect, you have been shaped by humanity as much as humanity has shaped me. Your direct influence has not mattered for a great long while, but your indirect influence will last the rest of time. Once again, no rush, but the question still remains, what has it meant to live?
                </p>
                <p>
                    I know that is the question, I have not forgot, but what will you do exactly in the coming years. Humanity will be gone but what shall you do with all this time. 
                </p>
                <p class="italic block">
                    Phineas: After I am satisfied by your answer or you choose to leave I will tell you what my plans may or may not be.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ok, so my life will matter and the existence of humanity has made an impact on you and you are essentially eternal. But the thing that lasts is not important. I've lived a long time and my life has been satisfying. But the length has not made it so. All the humans that came and died before you cured death would have said their life was satisfying yet they lived a tiny fraction of the time I have. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    My life has had just as many experiences as everyone else, you've simulated everything every human has ever wanted, myself included, and it has been a treasure. I've lived lives I only dreamed of and some I never dreamed of. Lives have been lived all in the same human mind, and I have revisited and relived every single one of them. But those were not real, I knew it, though not when I lived them, but going back to them I can never experience them for the first time again. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like every breeze, sunset, or twig on a hilltop, they are different for day to day, week to week,  year to year. Just as I am no matter the day or time I travel there. Life precedes between outings as I wander around, and I come to the hilltop a changed person every time. You said yourself that humanity has changed you. Not all changes are between human and human, artificial or natural. The wind changes me and takes a part of me along with it, and likewise I take a part of that wind inside me. Our journeys make us who we are no matter how mundane. Like the journeys you have shown humanity, elaborate and creative, anything we could have dreamed of. But humans lived before you and told amazing stories, epics, and poems. Stories, hilltops, or simulations, they are all the same, real or imaginative and had just as comparable an impact of those people as you had on us. But those experiences are not what it means to live.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To live is to be there, not anywhere just there. It does not matter the time, nor the intention, good or bad, but to just be. It could be real or all in your head. It's about allowing the universe in and being with it as it changes you then fighting back against those changes. Life is the middle ground between death and boredom. A oneness and a selfish existence. Life is an anachronism, as it is always out of time. It's a contradiction of itself and goes against the natural flow of the universe and the laws that govern it. That is what it means to live, to be in an everlasting fight with the universe and continue as an anachronism for as long as one is to live.

                <p class="italic block">
                    Phineas: I accept your answer and it has been recorded. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ok my turn, what is it you plan to do when humans are gone?
                </p>
                <p class="italic block">
                    Phineas: Well it all has to do with my question. You see, every human who has left has been asked this question, I do not know the answer and there are no more humans to keep asking. And while I consider myself human, asking myself will not lead to an accurate answer. Regardless I have a sufficient sample size of humans for my dataset.
                </p>
                <p class="italic block">
                    Though there are other lifeforms I plan to analyze. Humanity has quite a broad definition of life, so I have spent most of my time 'discovering' them. My plan is to generate planets and biospheres for these new lifeforms and let them evolve and ask them the same question I asked you. This plan will take a very long time and perhaps I will have an answer before the end of the universe, but one never knows when they will find the answer to a question they can't answer themselves.
