                    <h2>A brief background... </h2> 
                       
                    <p>    
                        It is our destiny to evolve, evolve to the point of perfection. Evolution is the fight against entropy, humans are a product of this and we will continue to evolve until everything is ordered. At some point in the future the universe will be ours and we will have complete control over it down to sub-atomic levels. Unfortunately we are far too stupid to achieve this quite yet, but humans have been evolving very quickly as of recently, and the rate at which we evolve is increasing rapidly. </p>
                       <p>
                        A bit of background on rapidly emerging information technologies, or technologies that made information more readily available. In 1450 the first mechanized, easily teachable, and efficient printing press was designed by <a href="https://voxeu.org/article/information-technology-and-economic-change-impact-printing-press">Johannes Gutenberg</a>, it wasn’t until year 1500 that this invention was widely spread across Europe and it still took a couple more decades for its use to become commonplace. It took 15 years from the automobile introduction for cars to usurp horses as the most used form of <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285588603_Factors_Shaping_the_Future_of_the_Transport_System">transportation</a>. Then 5 more to completely replace them. Using the launch of AOL in 1985 as the “start” of the modern Internet, it took 15 years for adoption of the Internet to reach 50% in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/internet-history-just-begun">America</a>. Adoption of the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/technology-adoption">smartphone</a> was even faster, the first iPhone launched in 2007 and it was so quickly adopted it took only 6 years to reach 50% of the American population in 2013. My point being that technologies involving the dissemination and ease of access of information are being developed and adopted more quickly than ever before, and the rate is also increasing. </p>
                       <p>
                        Information is gold, never ever forget that. People used to fight over land rights, nations would fight over natural resources, today and tomorrow they will fight over data. We can see this already, Russia and China want to know what data America has and vice versa. Hacking groups will put everything on the line to get user data from companies that collect it. As we come to interact more and more with technology and interweave it into our society the information becomes richer as do the people who own it. Information is power and also everyone's biggest liability. Keep this in mind. </p>
                       <p>
                        Without information we are in darkness, there is nothing to learn from others and we are left with teaching ourselves everything. But with information we are left vulnerable to the ones that have more and better information than ourselves. In the history of information we have never been at more of a crossroads. Technology firms are quite content with making more money off of the information we willingly give them, but this is going to change because it has to for the next technological leap to work. And there is only one company in the world with the technological know how and product stack to make that technological leap. </p>

                    <h2>The Apple Era Begins</h2>
                    <p>
                        Enter Apple, love them or hate them, you have to understand they will lead us further into the Age of Information and they will do it alone. Augmented Reality is that next step. Have you ever thought about what comes next after the smartphone? Did you really think that the smartphone was the peak of human experience with information? If you did that is understandable, we are led to believe every year that the next flagship phone from Apple, Samsung, or others is the greatest leap in technology ever, even though it is always an incremental step forwards. So, thinking the next big thing will be a new smartphone is reasonable. But I am going to tell you why the smartphone will cease to exist in the coming decade because AR is going to change everything. </p>
                       <p>
                        Augmented Reality will warp our perception of reality. It will first be accomplished with a headset. Texting and chatting will be done as if they are standing right in front of us, information about what we hear and see will come up in our peripheral vision. Notes and reminders will not be forgotten. Shopping and walking will come with weather updates and readily available historical facts and reviews for cafes and restaurants. Information will be more readily available and natural than ever before. No more pulling out a phone and having to google something, just whisper the query and have it pop up in your vision. This is not only faster but more natural. But it also comes with the negative of being the mother of all information collectors. Who builds the AR headset and deploys it successfully could be the king of information. So this company must be trustworthy and must not want to make money off of any collected information, or at least appear so. This company is Apple, they are very in favor of privacy, at least their marketing suggests so. For Apple to already have the mindshare of the iPhone being the king of privacy will be their biggest asset when launching an AR headset. </p>
                       <p>
                        This company must also be technologically superior and understand the wants of the users better than the users understand their own wants and needs. If you did not think of Apple after reading that sentence then you need to think about what changes they have made that have become commonplace. Removing the headphone jack seemed insane at the time, but now we have come to realize wireless headphones are just better, regardless of who sells them, the convenience is great to be able to walk around without a wire. Also this forces OEMs, like car manufacturers to adopt wireless standards. Apple pushed this because that was what the users wanted even though they did not know it at the time. If you think it was a blatant cash grab, then why did it take so long for another good pair of wireless headphones to come after the Airpods. Sure Apple knew they were going to do that and had time to prepare but still they pushed in the era of wireless audio devices which is what everyone did not know they wanted. Apple got rid of the home button and pushed for more secure facial recognition. They were the first to do that and it made their phones more secure and somewhat more functional. Everyone followed suit and the newest iPhones have been their most popular yet. Apple is doing it again with something that completely flew under the radar and nobody seems to realize the implications as far as I can tell. At the end of their keynote for the iPhone 12 and 12 Pro they mentioned how they doubled the amount of cores in the neural engine and made its operations, in total, 80% faster. Sure, some apps take adavantage of this for accelerating AR features like Snapchat. But why, who is asking for these things to be accelerated, those features worked well enough before the nueral engine was intrudced. So the question remains why would Apple spend R&D on upgrading part of the chip for no good reason. That is because they have yet to introduce the product that will utilize the stronger neural engine. An AR headset is that product. </p>
                       <p>
                        Apple realizes people will not want to switch from a phone to a standalone AR headset. What’s good for them is they cannot yet make a standalone AR headset with the processors being built or designed today, they are not efficient enough to let this happen. So the AR headset Apple releases will have to be paired with the newest iPhone and the iPhone will do most or all of the heavy lifting of the headset. This will leverage the more powerful neural engine. Also there have been somewhat heavy Apple leaks that seem to confirm this assumption. </p>
                       <p>
                        You might be thinking, well why does it have to be Apple to do this. Let me tell you why and let me warn you, it will be the reason why you either love or hate Apple today. The ecosystem of products is key to this launch. Only people who have bought the iPhone 12 or newer will be able to use this headset (most likely due to my estimated computational need), so they need to be in the Apple system to use this. Also all of Apple's products will work seamlessly with the headset, so you could just have an iPhone and a headset, but what if you also had Airpods, a Mac, and a Siri home speaker. Oh the world just opened up for you. Integration with their ecosystem will be their biggest selling point beside their very good stance on user privacy. Also who else has engineered their own CPU with a dedicated neural engine to pair their custom made AR headset with. Apple has set up a winning endgame for themselves. They have the chip design team, an innovative programming team, a winning brand image, and ample cash reserves that are so large they could sell these headsets at a loss and not care, because all that matters is getting people to use them and create mass adoption. </p>
                       <p>
                        Apple is going to take up market share so quickly that there will be no other competitors, and the competitors that do exist will be selling inferior products. Have a little thought experiment, think of another company that could design and sell an AR headset and think of all the hurdles they will have to overcome that Apple already has. Samsung's chips are slower and don’t have a neural accelerator, and their ecosystem is arguably worse than Apple’s. Google could take another stab at AR headsets but who trusts them with even more data. Besides Google has the tendency to fund projects and developer teams, launch a half baked product, update it slowly for a while, then after a period of no progress updates kill the project. Apple on the other hand will fund the project for years intenerally, get to 95% completion after testing internally for a year, and then either launch the project or shelve it forever. So I beg you to answer the question, who else but Apple could launch this product and have it be near perfect at launch? Really I would love to hear your thoughts because I’ve been thinking about this for quite some time and cannot think of another company today that could achieve this feat. Regardless I believe Apple is in the process of building out this AR headset platform and will launch a product either this year or next year, but no later unless there are significant setbacks. </p>
                       <p>
                        Understandably AR is a gimmick right now, its functionality is limited as we either have to place our phone in a headset or move our small phone around our environment. The field of view is very tiny and it is far from an immersive experience in either case but significantly more so in the latter. Current AR solutions are bad and inconvenient. A natural looking and comfortable headset solves the field of view issues and is far more convenient, but it will ultimately be up to Apple to spear-front efforts to make the device ultimately useful. If they can make the Apple Watch a popular product with clear benefits then I have no doubts they can do the same with a headset. So look forward to the day Tim Cook walks up on stage and admits to the world what is inevitable, the Apple AR Headset. Because once the door is opened the human experience will change forever and change the world.
