                <div class="content">
                    <p>CW: This is basically a yearlong diary I have come back to mutiple times. It has helped me mentally and physically to get what has really been going on my whole life into words. I don't know how this could help anyone else but it has helped me. It is a bit everywhere and jumps around but I feel I've never written anything that has made more sense to myself ever before. Fair warning.</p>
                    <p>I went a couple months of occasionally getting high alone before I realized something. For those months I would say “I don’t know I just like being high alone” if anyone asked why I indulged myself in this. Then one time I actually asked myself (as I was getting high) “Why do I say that?” And that was when I realized just how quiet it was. One of the most lucid thoughts I’ve ever had in my life. I didn’t hear the traffic noises, the toilet flushes, loud speakers, computer fans, fire truck alarms, people talking outside, footsteps, doors being closed, any of the background songs in my head, nor the constant internal monologue. I heard for the first time when I was relaxed and nothing was going on, nothing. All those things could be chosen to be heard of course, but I’ve never had that option before. I heard nothing.</p>
                    <p>As I come off the high the inner conscious bits of me return and all goes back to normal. The inner dialogues come back and they bother and help me throughout my day. When I ask a question they shout answers, when I daydream they provide entertainment. I mean is it normal when asked a question I feel as if my mind shouts two or more answers and I have to pick whose I think is the best? Or when I ask myself what my favorite color is I could say out loud blue and my mind thinks green? This may not be normal but that’s how its always been for me. Sometimes my inner dialogues plays the pessimist, sometimes the optimist, and sometimes is just the biggest believer in me. It just depends on my mood and what happened that day. </p>
                    <p>I am unable to think in color like other people. Say you tell me to picture a picnic, red checkered blanket, basket, trees, grass, fruits, salads, etc. I can see that in my minds eye and I know the colors of everything, but I don’t see it that way. All of it goes to grayscale (sort of) and focusing on any of it doesn’t result in it having color. If you were to ask me to rearrange the rainbow (ROYGBIV) into brightest to darkest colors, without actually looking at a rainbow. I would say the order is Yellow, Orange, Blue, Green, Indigo, Violet, and Red. Which is an unnatural question to just imagine color, without actually seeing color or looking at a reference, and ordering them brightest to darkest. Makes sense to me but I’ve had friends say that’s a weird question, any they think it odd I don’t imagine color while they do. </p>
                    <p>Nor can I imagine faces of my family or lifelong friends. I remember landmark features but to ask me to draw them from memory, forget about it. My mom might as well be a 8 year old drawing of a woman with spaghetti hair if I were asked to draw her from memory. I will be no help to the police if I witness anything that’s for sure.</p>
                    <p>Maybe I have undiagnosed ADHD, ADD, or maybe I’m further along the spectrum then I would have guessed. Or a combination of those, among other things. Even so, after talking with friends and thinking about my life and everything I’ve experienced, it all makes way more sense in the perspective of any of those conditions. Maybe I need diagnosed and meds, and maybe that would provide help and closure, but it’s also scary to think how that knowledge could change my life going forward. How would my parents judge me, they never saw me struggle, I never showed it except in brief glimpses to teachers. Even they thought I had it in control.</p>
                    <p>College has been a new challenge, I have nobody to let down other than myself, and some days I find it easy to let that happen. I can go between three or more different tasks for hours and get nowhere on all of them. It’s not just procrastination, I literally can’t do them. You could point a gun to my head and I would hesitate. I can’t help but feel this is getting worse. So many distractions pulling me away from the degree I want. I want to do well but I want it to be easy, I want to win but have to do it with the least amount of effort possible. I’m ok with being second best if the amount of effort to be first is considerably more than getting second. Writing that doesn’t make me happy but I know its true. The drive and force I can put into myself to get to the finish line is crazy compared to how little I will put in to just cross the finish line. </p>
                    <p>Even so I’ve never ended up worse off for my efforts. Everything has always worked out for me. But I can’t tell if that’s because I set my bar to low or am at my potential. I really doubt it’s the latter. </p>
                    <p>And it’s not like I don’t goal set, before summer started I wanted to workout everyday, start work on a coding project, and among other things find more time for myself. But I can never even seem to start some of those things. I even have a list but that hasn’t helped.</p>
                    <p>But what has helped, as I read through this months later as I often do with these posts, is to be around people. Specifically good people. Some can find meaning in the solitude, others find lonesome and destructive behavior. I won’t say I didn’t learn things about myself when high and alone, those were some of the most introspective moments of my life. But I will say being with others who care is better than any drug. People you can be honest with, people you can trust, are the ones worth keeping around. They only problem is they all leave eventually, some sooner than others and its worth it to make every moment count. </p>
